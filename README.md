# NYC Event Guide
This is a project for the course Foundations of Web Design.
The idea was to create a responsive website, with the main purpose to inform about the cultural events that are happening in NYC. There are several different categories, each one further divided into several subcategories so that the end user can easily find the events they are interested in.
The full documentation is provided as part of this github repository.
